# A simple recipes website

This is the repository of a website with a few of my favourite recipes. I am building this website as a part of my web development learning via The Odin Project. By building this website, I show that I:

* Know how to use basic HTML elements, such as headings, links and images, to make simple webpages

* Understand how to link webpages together using relative paths

* Can use git and github to track my progress in building this website
