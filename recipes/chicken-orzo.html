<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A creamy and filling orzo recipe that is all made in one pot. I recommend using a large pan with tall sides (also known as a French pan or dutch oven).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g chicken thigh</li>
        <li>500g risoni</li>
        <li>400g diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 red capsicum</li>
        <li>750mL chicken stock</li>
        <li>200mL heavy cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (add according to taste)</li>
        <li>Red wine (for deglazing the pan)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Herb mix</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons Italian herb mix</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the onion and capsicum and set aside.</li>
        <li>Dice the chicken into small pieces and drizzle over with olive oil. Add the herb mix to the chicken and combine with hands.</li>
        <li>Heat the french pan to medium-high and brown the chicken until just cooked.</li>
        <li>Adjust heat to low and remove chicken from pan. Add capsicum and onions and saute for 2-3 minutes. While cooking, add red wine to deglaze brown spots on the base of the pan.</li>
        <li>Adjust heat to medium and add chicken stock and tomatoes. When the liquid begins to bubble slightly, add orzo.</li>
        <li>Cook the orzo for as long as indicated on the package. <strong>Stir the orzo continuously to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan</strong></li>
        <li>When the Orzo is almost cooked, add cream and stir through.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken back into the orzo and recombine.</li>
        <li>If wanted, add Parmesan cheese and stir through. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
